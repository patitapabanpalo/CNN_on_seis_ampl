# CNN_on_seis_ampl
To run the code first unzip the data present in the two folders Data_Patch and Data_Point. The data are synthetic data and in .csv format. All the files for testing and training are the .rar files, that needs to be extracted.

The code for even patches are cnn_patch_<patch_size>

The code for odd patches (point analysis) are cnn_point_<patch_size>
